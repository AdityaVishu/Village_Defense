#    - broadcast Game %ARENA-ID% has ended!   # Will broadcast "Game <arena name here> has ended" message
#    - chance(1):p:say I was very lucky!              # Player has 1% chance to say "I was very lucky!"
#    - p:chance(99):spawn                             # Player has 99% chance to teleport to spawn
#       ^ YOU CAN EVEN SWAP CHANCE WITH PLAYER!
